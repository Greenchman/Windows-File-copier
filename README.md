# Resolving Windows folder path 255 character limit during copy to another folder or drive
# Python-script-to-copy-files-and-folders 
# This is for windows which i have tested on pycharm
# Tried to create something but not so purposefully, wish this can help you.
# fill free to reconstruct it,'
# let's see how to use it
 
 first it will ask you for the source folder or disk path you can give it like "d:" or for folder "d:\hello" 
 please use absalute path.
 
 second it will ask you about the destination folde path and again you have to use absalute path ex "e:\one\two"
 
 third it will ask about a folder name for the folder which are more then 255 character.
 
 once you done this and every thing is ok then it will take some time to complete the process , it depends on your data capacity.
 
 after it completes you will see a "path.txt" which may be containg the folder it failed to copy  and check your destination folder size with the source folder 
 to get the complete overview about all the data is copied to the destination.
 
 # this is tasted for windows , fill free to test it on linux .
